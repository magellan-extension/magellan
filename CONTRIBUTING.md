# Contributing to Magellan

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Magellan! This is our first open-source project, and we're excited to have you join us. This guide is meant to be friendly and straightforward.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Found something that doesn't work as expected? Let us know! When reporting a bug, it helps if you can tell us:

- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- What browser you're using
- If possible, include a screenshot

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea to make Magellan better? We'd love to hear it! When suggesting a feature:

- Tell us what you'd like to see
- Explain why it would be helpful
- If you've seen something similar elsewhere, let us know

### Making Changes

Want to help improve the code? Great! Here's how:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Test that everything still works
4. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `magellan` repository
3. Make your changes
4. Test that everything works
5. Submit a pull request

## Code Style

We try to keep the code clean and readable, but we're not too strict. Here are some general guidelines:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Try to follow the existing code style
- Use clear names for variables and functions
- Add comments if something is complex
- Use JSDoc comments for functions (but don't worry if you miss some)

## Before Submitting

Before you submit your changes, please:

1. Test that your changes work in Chrome
2. Try it on a few different websites
3. Make sure you haven't broken anything else
4. Check the browser console for any errors

## Pull Requests

When you're ready to submit your changes:

1. Describe what you changed and why
2. Let us know if you need any help
3. We'll review it and let you know if we need any adjustments

## Git Commit Messages

Try to make your commit messages clear, but don't stress too much about the format. Something like:

- "Add feature to highlight text"
- "Fix bug with API key validation"
- "Update documentation"

## Questions?

Not sure about something? Just ask! Open an issue with your question, and we'll help you out.

## Labels

We use these simple labels to organize issues:

- `bug` - Something's not working
- `enhancement` - New feature idea
- `documentation` - Help with docs
- `help wanted` - Could use some help
- `question` - Just asking
